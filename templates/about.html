      <h3>🌙 Inspired by a Personal Experience</h3>
      <p>
        On the 27th night of Ramadan, I performed Umrah with over 4.2 million pilgrims. The spiritual beauty was profound—but the overwhelming crowd also revealed critical gaps in navigation and safety. That moment inspired this platform.
